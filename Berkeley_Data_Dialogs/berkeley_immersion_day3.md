**A. Leadership session: A Changing World**

- "software is eating the world"
- "can you think of any profession not yet impacted by digital?"
- one industry that has faced a lot of "disruption":
	- airline industy
	- Southwest exactly copied Pacific Southwest Airlines
- disciplined innovation
- "you need to have a process for experimentation"
	- you have to build a culture of experimentation
	- you need the discipline to stop - kill "zombie ideas"
	- **Avoid the temptation of uncalibrated bets**
1. Disciplined innovation
	- robust process for experimentation
	- discipline to stop
		- can you admit things aren't working and move on?
	- scale the most validated experiment
	- avoid the temptation of uncalibrated bets
		- i.e. bets not informed by experimentation
2. Disciplined Focus
	- a lot of companies are spread way too thin
	- "if you are trying to do everything, then how can you be great?"
	- your work suffers, you get very stressed, if you say yes to too many things
