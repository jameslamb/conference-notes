##A. Developments in Derivatives Markets

- what is compression?
	- compression is a restructuring of financial positions to preserve all parties' net positions while reducing network-wide gross notional value
- why would firms want to compress?
	- some capital standards are in gross terms
- "as much as 60% of notional value in CDS markets may be excess"
	- excess is defined as the difference between gross and net positions (more or less)
	-  e.g. if A gives 10 to B, B gives 5 to C, C gives 20 to A then:
		- gross: 35
		- net: 10 (A) + 5 (B) + 15 (C) = 30
- you can actually find in bloomberg whether or not a trade was created for the purpose of compression
- a "cool idea":
	- could you write a "crisis compression" algorithm which removes a single problematic node (say failing Lehman bros) while preserving all parties' net positions?

##C. Complexity Economics and Evolution

**1: Evolution + Insitutionalism**

- systemism --> "any object or entity is either a system or a part of one"
- systems:
	- elements
	- structure of elements
	- mechanisms of the system
	- its environment
- focus on:
	- parts
	- nontrivial sets of relations representing direct interdependence
	- emergent properties that may feed back on the elements on lower ontological levels
- many people working in complexity economics are not originally economists
- difference between inferences of states (prediction) or inference of mechanisms
- complex systems --> focus is on inference of mechanisms
- institutional economics also relies on "inference of mechanisms"
- mechanisms is a harder discrimination problem:
	- how do you determine which of two mechanism inferences is correct?
	- much more difficult that evaluating competing *predictions*

**2: Broad Approach to Evolutionary Modelling in Economics**

- creative destruction formalized into "innovation economics" with agent-based modelling
- in economics, you can potentially get "potential conscious interference by agents"
	- and no obvious genotype-phenotype distinction
- evolution is:
	- diversification (innovation)
	- diffusion (imitation)
	- selection process
- how much information does an evolutionary sytem contain?
	- biological genome is a few hundred gigabytes
- economics:
	- no sequential encoding
	- less constrained, larger possibility space
- central problem in this domain is how to quantify econded information

**3: Obesity and socioeconomic status**

- in modern society, obesity rates tend to be higher in lower class communities
- idea (from Veblen): rich will indulge in "conspicuous consumption"
	- today the rich "conspicuously consume" fitness
- agent-based investigation:
	- using Engel's cost (BEC)
	- incentives: cost of calories, cost of weight stigma, utility from food
- low class people want to choose the same strategy as high class people, high class people want the opposite
- key result:
	- lowering cost of calorie intake drives the system toward an a state with lower health outcomes for lower-class people

**4. global trade and global value chains**

- "gains (from GVC participation) for headquarter nations tend to be greater than gains for factory countries"

##D. Economics of National Security

- "economics of national security may be the most important understudied area of economics"
- national security dataset: esna.us.com ("Economics of National Security")

**1. Flow of Foreign FIghters to ISIS**

- Piketty: unemployment and hiring discrimination "does not help" in keeping French targets of ISIS recruitment efforts in France
- no evidence found that improving economic conditions will have a meaningful impact on ISIS recruitment from developed nations
- conjecture:
	- some places in Europe where you have "equality" but no opportunity/social mobility are more likely to breed ISIS recruits
	- maybe you need some "inequity" but "opportunity" to keep people away from radical ideologies

**2. Bombing Civilian Populations in Vietnam**

- identification strategy:
	- hamlets (bombing targets) scored on a continuous scale from 1-5
	- but because of state of computer technology, had to be rounded to integer for printing
	- can take the algo outputs (4.49 vs. 4.51) to compare essentially identical neighborhoods that were/were not bombed
- "declassified memos reveal that it was deemed to difficult and time-consuming to print continuous security scores from memory, instead they were rounded"
	- researchers found the information necessary to reproduce the algorithm in a basement at Fort McNair
- another natural experiment:
	- Marines fought a "hearts and minds" battle, army most just bombed stuff

**3. The Value of Statistical Life: Evidence from Military Retention Incentives**

- there are congressionally-mandated limits on how many soldiers we can have in certain occupations
- "men in combat occupations have lower VSLs than women and men in non-combat occupations"
