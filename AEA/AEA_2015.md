## Speaker Notes

### DAY 1

#### Session 1: Tail Risks

**A1. Uncertainty Shocks and Black Swans**

- speakers: [Anna Orlik](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/anna-orlik.htm)
- paper: [Understanding Uncertainty Shocks and the Role of Black Swans](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20445)
- uncertainty = conditional standard deviation
- counter to [GARCH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity):
	- no one knows true distribution of outcomes
	- re-estimation every period
- GARCH:
	- take parameters and look back
	- people in beginning of sample don't know!
- [Bayesian stats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics) = bring in prior beliefs
- [Metropolis-Hastings algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm) - a MCMC method for obtaining a sequence of random samplese from a probability distribution for which direct sampling is difficult
- linear hidden state models, e.g. [Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter)
- learning and exponential twist = large uncertainty
- [Black swan risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) = risk of tail events
	- driver of changes in uncertainty
- "skewness keeps fluctuating because it is hard to learn"
- small revisions make a big difference in the tail
	- your tail risk could double or triple withouot being noticed
- a string of positive realizaitons builds fragility
- uncertainty is counter-cyclical
	- comes from skewed distribution
- "when we estimate parameter uncertainty and skewness, we match forecast bias"
- stochastic volatility --> regimes
- "maybe true variance isn't changing, but beliefs are"
- tail risk changes the way that many types of volatility vary

**A2. Interest Rate Uncertainty and Economic Fluctuations**

- speakers: [Drew Creal](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/drew.creal/), [Jing Cynthia Wu](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/jing.wu/)
- paper: [Interest Rate Uncertainty and Economic Fluctuations](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/drew.creal/research/papers/crealWu2014_unc.pdf)
- Bayes again
- VARS with log(var) depvar
- analogous to financial [leverage effect](https://www.princeton.edu/~yacine/leverage.pdf)
- exponentially [affine](https://web.stanford.edu/~piazzesi/s.pdf)
- [unspanned volatility](http://www.nber.org/papers/w12744)
- [particle filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter)
- short-term uncertainty shocks have long-lasting impact on inflation
- increase in short-term uncertainty = lower inflation
- conditional impulse-response:
	- change depends on state of economy
- more yield factors = better fit of cross section of [yield curve](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp)
- better performance than GARCH
- use of [Gaussian affine term structure](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17772)
- more factors = much better fit on longer yields
- uncertainty = second moments yield volatility

**A3. Sovereign Tail Risk**

- speaker: [Antonio Moreno](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D61ntkQAAAAJ&hl=de)
- paper: [Sovereign Tail Risk](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2015/retrieve.php?pdfid=229)
- exposure phenomenon = some countries more exposed to tail risk than others
- good fundamentals are more important in the tail(s)
- use of a [fixed-effects panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_effects_model) with [double-clustered standard errors](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8389843/double-clustered-standard-errors-for-panel-data)
- GDP-weighted global risk higher in 2012 than 2007-2009
- euro risk much higher in 2012 than 2009
- higher debt-to-GDP = higher exposure to sovereign default risk
- fundamentals most helpful when you need them most
- [TED spreadh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TED_spread) as measure of global liquidity
- sovereign debt levels impact exposure

#### Session 2: Unconventional Monetary Policy

**B1.  Fed Policy**

- speakers: [Thomas Laubach](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/thomas-laubach.htm), [Eric M Engen](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/eric-m-engen.htm)
- paper: [The Macroeconomic Effects of the Federal Reserve's Unconventional Monetary Policies](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2015/files/2015005pap.pdf)
- unconventional policies:
	- [quantitative easing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing)
	- [forward guidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_guidance)
- impossible to disentangle effects of asset purchases and forward guidance
- unemployment about 1.25pp lower than withouot unconventional policy, inflation 0.4pp higher
- comparison of survey results to [Taylor rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_rule) prescription --> some measusre of policy effect
- macro effect of perceived changes in perceived post-liftoff rule are larger the longer you are in the [zero lower bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_lower_bound)
- if all actions fully anticipated, their effects are doubled
	- communicate, early on, that you are ready to do what is necessary

**B1.D Discussion of B1**

- speaker: [Refet Gurkaynak](http://refet.bilkent.edu.tr/research.html)
- unconventional policies worked (esp. on long-term rates), but maybe not enough
- unconventional policy worked mostly by reducing term premia
- impossible in [DSGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_stochastic_general_equilibrium) models
- [FRBUS](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/frbus/us-models-package.htm) --> [Lucas critique](http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_L000159&q=lucas%20critique&topicid=&result_number=1)?
- are the changes in expectations really due to unconventional policies?
- "...the best answers we can give to these imprtant questions are not strong enough. We do not yet have the technology."

**B2. ECB's 3-Year LTROs**

- speaker: [Roberto A De Santis](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/authors/profiles/roberto-a-de-santis.en.html)
- paper: [A Non-Standard Monetary Policy Shock: The ECB's 3-Year LTROS and the Shift in Credit Supply](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1508.pdf?2d1bdcc49f8e9c6212ec02c9fe367282)
- [LTRO](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omo/html/index.en.html) = "long-term refinancing operations"
- [panel VAR](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1507.pdf?0ea674f009d6f2bffb1515c8b4b2cab6) estimated with [GMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_method_of_moments)
- OLS is inconsistent with fixed effects
- [Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter) is useful here
- "without LTRO, we would have had a huge credit crunch"
- bank lending survey to identify credit supply shocks
	- LTROs trated as a shift in credit supply
- [cholesky decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition) = recursive

**B3. Provision of Liquidity**

- speakers: [Philippe Andrade](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZjrpWmsAAAAJ&hl=en), [Christophe Cahn](http://www.christophecahn.fr/), [Henri Fraisse](https://sites.google.com/a/cornell.edu/henri-fraisse/cv), [Jean-Stephane Mesonnier](https://www.banque-france.fr/economie-et-statistiques/la-recherche/economistes-et-chercheurs/cv/jean-stephane-mesonnier.html)
- paper: [Can the Provision of Long-term Liquidity Help to Avoid a Credit Crunch?](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2015/retrieve.php?pdfid=857)
- bank lending channel:
	- idea that injection of public liquidity alleviates financial frictions that impede credit
- LTROs = 80% of euro monetary base
- only big banks benefitted
- France has data on dependence of bank i on firm j
- maturity swap matter more than supply
- only first offering of LTROs mattered:
	- elimination of stigma between 1 and 2
	- banks that went in the first round were weaker (less capitalized)
- LTROs only impacted credit supply from large firms

**B3.D Discussion of B3**

- speaker: [James Vickery](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/economists/vickery)
- bank-firm pair
- general equilibrium vs partial equilibrium
- firm fixed-effects can't partial out *composition* of loan demand (lines of credit, mortgages, equipment loans)
- "LTROs had positive effects on bank lending due to financial frictions"

**B4. Exiting from QE**

- speakers: [Fumio Hayashi](https://sites.google.com/site/fumiohayashi/home), [Junko Koeda](https://sites.google.com/site/junkokoeda/)
- paper: [Exiting from QE](http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/Exiting-from-QE.pdf)
- use of [structural VARs](http://economics.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/svars_format.pdf)
- BOJ made commitements to exit conditions (forward guidance) as early as 1999
- "shadow Taylor rate"
	- censoring at the [zero lower bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_lower_bound)
- exit condition comes into play in ZLB setting
- excess reserve supply as a [tobit model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobit_model)
- [Gallant-Rossi-Tauchen impulse response](http://public.econ.duke.edu/~get/wpapers/GRT1993.pdf)
- QE is expansionary (not surprising)
- exit preceded by drop in ratio of actual to required reserves
- what would have happened if BoJ did not exit QE?
	- less inflation, lower output if they did not exit
	- lower interest rate, higher excess reserves
- exiting from QE was (counterintuitively), *expansionary*!
- counter at fixed cost of QE
	- you need to really be aggressive in QE

**B4.D Discussion of B4**

- exiting QE
	- time variation in real interest rate
- not clear that QE could work without acting in longer-term interest rates
- how much of variations in LT rates attribute to monetary policy?
	- using high frequency data ("event studies") might be better
- could look at [swap rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_rate)
